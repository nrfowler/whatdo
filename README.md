# whatdo
WhatDo is a command line todo-list program.

The key function of WhatDo is generating a schedule of tasks based on the users location, time available, and other circumstances. It's goal is to provide an realistic, intelligent TodoList, rather than most Todolist applications, which simply aggregate all tasks based on their due date and/or importance.

The user can specify how many hours they are able to work. WhatDo find the most useful tasks that can fit in that timeframe, and creates a schedule for the user. The "usefulness" is based on a quantity set for each task: the "utility." In other words WhatDo is designed to create a todo list to yield the greatest Utility in a given timeframe, similar to the Philosophy of Utilitarianism.

Future versions will allow the user to restrict on the location of tasks, effort level of the tasks, and more.
