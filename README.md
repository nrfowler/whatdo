# whatdo
WhatDo is a command line todo-list program.

The key function of WhatDo is generating a schedule of tasks based on the users location, time available, and other circumstances. It's goal is to provide an "intelligent" TodoList, rather than most Todolist applications, which simply aggregate all tasks based on their due date, with no processing based on the user's availability within a particular working day to accomplish such tasks.
